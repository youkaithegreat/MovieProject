# Movie Poster Project 
This project uses python to create a website that shows various movie posters with their related information. Upon clicking on the poster it opens a new window with the related youtube trailer. 

## How to Run
The main file is entertainment_center.py and should be the one being built. The entertainment_center.py file requires the media.py as well as fresh_tomatoes.py. Upon build it will display the website using the default browser. 

### Notes 
The fresh_tomatoes.py was cloned from the udacity provided repository. One of the movies isn't actually a movie and is just a joke I put in there.
